      <p class="font-light text-gray-200">
        I'm a Front-End Developer with five years of hands-on experience in
        building web projects with Vue, Nuxt, CSS, and TypeScript. Iâ€™ve worked
        on a range of sites and applications for ecommerce and automotive
        brands, focusing on creating smooth, engaging user experiences. I enjoy
        the challenge of bringing a design to life and making sure every
        interaction feels intuitive and refined.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work, my interests include hiking, exploring the world,
        health and staying active with sports. I'm always looking for new ways
        to grow and learn, so I can keep pushing myself to be better than I was
        yesterday.
